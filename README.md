# Disaster-Response-Pipelines
Disaster Response Pipeline Project 

Create a machine learning pipeline to categorize messages sent during disaster events so that the messages are sent to an appropriate disaster relief agency. We will build a model to classify messages that are sent during disasters. There are 36 pre-defined categories. By classifying these messages, we can allow these messages to be sent to the appropriate disaster relief agency. This project will involve the building of a basic ETL and Machine Learning pipeline to facilitate the task. This is also a multi-label classification task, since a message can belong to one or more categories. 
In this project we will be working with a data set provided by Figure Eight containing real messages that were sent during disaster events.
The project also includes a web app where you can input a message and get classification results with visualization of data.
